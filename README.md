This project includes two C programs for managing a ski race event. The programs allow the input of skier information, categorizing them based on those who completed the race and those who abandoned.

- version0.c

This file represents the first version of the ski race management system. It utilizes a modular approach, defining structures for time and skiers. It employs functions to collect skier data and organizes them into separate linked lists for successful skiers and those who abandoned.


- version1.c

This file showcases the second version of the ski race management system. It adopts a more condensed structure, combining multiple steps within a single section of code. Similar to the first version, it uses linked lists to differentiate between successful skiers and abandonments. However, it implements data input and list organization within a more detailed and extended loop.
Usage

To use these programs:

    Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
    Run the compiled executable to manage the ski race event.
    Follow the prompts to input skier details and manage the race data.
